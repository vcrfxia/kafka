/**
 * A key-value store that stores multiple record versions per key, and supports timestamp-based
 * retrieval operations to return the latest record (per key) as of a specified timestamp.
 * Only one record is stored per key and timestamp, i.e., a second call to
 * {@link #put(Object, Object, long)} with the same key and timestamp will replace the first.
 * <p>
 * Each store instance has an associated, fixed-duration "history retention" which specifies
 * how long old record versions should be kept for. In particular, a versioned store guarantees
 * to return accurate results for calls to {@link #get(Object, long)} where the provided timestamp
 * bound is within history retention of the current observed stream time. (Queries with timestamp
 * bound older than the specified history retention are considered invalid.)
